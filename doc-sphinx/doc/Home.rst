<name>: Single-Molecule Analytical Research Toolbox
=================================


<name> is a single molecule analysis toolbox that automatically decodes multi-state nanopore data. By modeling the nanopore system with an equivalent circuit, <name> leverages the transient response of a molecule entering the channel to quantify pore-molecule interactions. In contrast to existing techniques such as ionic current thresholding {REFS} or Viterbi decoding {REFS}, this technique allows the estimation of short-lived transient events that are otherwise not analyzed.

Nanometer-scale pores have demonstrated potential use in biotechnology applications, including DNA sequencing {REFS}, single-molecule force spectroscopy {REFS}, and single-molecule mass spectrometry {REFS}. The data modeling and analysis methods implemented in <name> allow for dramatic improvements in the quantification of molecular interactions with the channel in each of these applications.

<name> is written in Python and developed in the Semiconductor and Device Metrology (`SDMD <http://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/about.cfm>`_) division, in the Physical Metrology Laborotory (`PML <http://www.nist.gov/pml/>`_) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (`NIST <http://www.nist.gov>`_).
