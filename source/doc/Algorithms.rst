Algorithms in |projname|
=================================

The techniques to process time-series from single-molecule nanopore experiments, outlined in the :ref:`introduction-page`, are implemented in |projname| using two separate algorithms, i) StepResponseAnalysis is used for events that exhibit a single state, and ii) MultistateAnalysis for *N*-state events.
